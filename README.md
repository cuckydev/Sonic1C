# Sonic1C
Sonic the Hedgehog (1991, Sega Genesis / MegaDrive) C Port.

# Technical Notes
The code aims to be as close as possible to the original assembly, which means there may be some undefined-behaviors such as out-of-bounds array accesses. So no warranty or whatever should that happen.

However there is an option enabled by default to fix major issues such as null pointer dereferences that would make the game crash. The original code is provided for completeness though.
